# Storytelling-Bounty---Personal-AI-Assistants
This is a story, depicting a day in a future where everyone can have a personal AI assistant. This story is for the gitcoin bounty by the same name.

"Wake up Sean."

It was the voice of my personal artificial intelligent assistant.

"What time is it Sarah?"

"It is 7 A.M. It is overcast and the weather is perfect for you to go for a run." I sometimes didn't like how over-enthusiastic Sarah sounded. But I set her up like this myself. I got up with a groan and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. I changed my clothes, grabbed my phone, and head out of the house. As soon as the cool air hit my face, I was wide awake. 

"So where do you think I should go, Sarah?" I said as I started a light jog. "You would love the top of the hill in the Sheldon park. Turn left after the second crossover, the park is three blocks away."

I slowly jogged while listening to a remix of my favorite songs that Sarah just made for this morning. I was panting when I reached the top of the hill. The view was spectacular. 

"Sean, might I remind you that you wanted to take up meditation. This is a good opportunity. I turn myself off for half an hour. You should enjoy this beautiful morning. If you need me, I would be a click away."

I sat there in solitude cooling down, trying to meditate. Sarah gave me a few lessons and guided meditations, but the scenery was too beautiful to take my mind out of it. 

After that, I head back home and took a shower. It was around 9 A.M that my doorbell rang and surprised me. "Who is at the door, Sarah?"

"I took the liberty of ordering breakfast. Last week you told me to randomly order your breakfast. It is after all the most important meal of the day." I could hear the smile in that voice. It is still astonishing to me, how human these personal assistants sound. You can assign an avatar when you personalize your AIPA ( Artificially Intelligent Personal Assistant) and have the face accompany the voice on all the screens around you. But I didn't want to. She seems too real as it is. I'm not judging the people who have a genuine feelings for their AI, but I'm not one of them. Tuning her voice, and giving her name is the most I'm willing to go. 

After a nice breakfast, which was something I didn't even know I wanted, I  started working. I was working on my master's thesis which was about theoretical physics. â€ŒSarah was a great help in this subject, because she had access to most of the free learning resources in the world, and she can fine-tune her explanations for me. Even better, she can ask other AIPAs about their experiences. Every personal assistant has a profile of their charge that can help them know how to act. The good part is they can share their charge's profile and their methods of interaction with other AIPAs, all without human interaction that could infringe on rights. 

after a couple of hours of intense learning, processing, and checking my calculations with the help of Sarah, I went to the kitchen to cook lunch. I was grateful that I had all the ingredients I wanted, fresh and clean thanks to automation and AI-assisted transport of goods to my doorstep. Cooking makes me relax, so this is one of the things I try to do at least once a day, no matter how much I'm worse at it than Sarah. I had a bit of nerves, because of my impending blind date. 

After lunch, I worked on my thesis again. I've learned so much in the last week that I was afraid I might forget about it, but Sarah reminded me often, saying she uses a method of spaced repetition for maximizing my recall. She told me they had separate programs back in the day for these kinds of memory techniques. 

"It is 5 P.M, Sean. You better get ready for your date." My heart fluttered. I was so entranced in my work that I didn't check the time. This was the first time I asked Sarah for help in setting up a date for me, and I wanted it to work out. I hurriedly took another quick shower and got dressed. I head out and sit in my car. 

"Ok Sarah, where is my date, and what is even her name?"

"She is called Bella and we are going to a coffee shop. She should be waiting at the entrance by then. John tells me there is a slight chance that she might be a couple of minutes late."

"Why a coffee shop? That is a lousy date if I ever heard one. And who is John?" I asked.

"John is Bella's Personal Assistant. We planned this date together. You need to know her before you can enjoy other activities together."

I was a bit apprehensive. After all, how do two computer programs know what is good on a date? But every experience I had with Sarah was telling me that she could pull this off. My friends also told me how much these AIPAs act like humans, only supercharged to do everything simultaneously. They can control a smart home, drive cars, read all the books and research papers there are, and even research on their own, all at the same time. I remember reading in one of my morning news that Cambridge University used data collected from anonymous AIPAs to conduct historical research. After all, the AIPAs know the history of what we eat, what we do, and how we act as long as we have them. The privacy laws dictate that people should opt in to have their data available for these kinds of research, but most people do. It is anonymous and helps people. Why shouldn't they opt in? 

So I decided to ignore my apprehension and try to enjoy the night. We reached the coffee shop. I got out and let Sarah take the car to the parking lot. There was a good-looking girl beside the entrance waving at me. I walked towards her.

"Hi. I'm Bella." She had a nice voice. "Are you Sean?" 

I smiled to my ear and said: "Yes, a pleasure to meet you. Let's go inside."

We went in and ordered some beverages. 

"So, what do you do?" I asked, to open up the small talk.

"I'm a bioengineer." She said with a dazzling smile. " I'm working on prosthetics that are virtually indistinguishable from the real deal."

"What? aren't they real enough? I can't tell them apart from real limbs."

"Oh, I meant to the owner." She said with a somewhat smug expression. "Since the last June that I got John, I'm working on rapidly improving my knowledge about robotics. A little AI inside the prosthetic can make it move exactly like the one the subject had before. With the same brain activity. But now I'm working on input. Making them sense and feel like the real limb is a bit harder than I thought. But we are getting there."

I was amazed by her passion when she talked about the work she was clearly proud of. We talked for a couple of hours, not even noticing our tea getting cold. We talked until getting simultaneous notifications on our phones. I checked my phone and it was Sarah. I think it was her idea of being considerate as to not say it out loud in the middle of our talk. 

"Sarah says she and John made an experience for us." I said to Bella.

"Yeah, John says we should head to the colosseum of VR. Do you mind if I come with you? It feels a bit dumb if we go in separate cars."

"Of course." I offered my hand to her and went outside. The cost of the coffee and tea would be automatically deducted. The car was there at the entrance, with open doors for us. 

We entered the car and buckled our seatbelts. After we introduced each other to our assistants, I asked Sarah about what we are going to do.

"We made a classic story that is a particular favorite of you two into an interactive 3d experience. Although it is quite long and we could only make the first half of the first book on such short notice."

I could feel Bella getting excited as she said: " No way! I can experience a Lord of the Rings VR made personally for me?" Then she looked at me and said: "Wait, you love Lord of the Rings too?"

I chuckled and said: "You can't find a more devoted fan of the franchise! It is a good thing that the original story is in the public domain now."

I was happy to share this day with such a lovely girl, who incidentally likes the things I like. 

We had a blast at the VR park. The equipment they have is leagues ahead of what I have at home. One reason is cost, but another reason is that they can afford to put people in giant spheres that mimic the ground and you can walk in them without even realizing you are not in the real world. I was amazed by how thoroughly these AIPAs could work. They made a complete 3d world with actors in the span of hours, just for our amusement. I even asked them to change one of the character's appearance because I could not imagine him with any face except the actor who played in the classic movie trilogy. They changed it in a blink of an eye. It was an amazing experience. 

It was around 11 P.M that we finally head out of the VR park. It was so fun that we didn't put a time to eat any dinner. Fortunately, both of us were more interested in the experience instead of the food. I know it sounds like blasphemy to some, but it works for us. Sarah drove us to Bella's house because John had already taken her car to her home. At her door we both agreed that we would do this again, hopefully soon to see the rest of the VR experience our assistants cooked up for us. She kissed my cheek goodbye, which made me a little disappointed because I was hoping for more, and I head back to my home. I was more tired than I thought I would be. Thankfully Sarah had a light snack ready for me before my sleep. 

"Thanks, Sarah, I really needed that. " I said after finishing.

"You are welcome, Sean. I hope you enjoyed your day."

"Yes, it was the best. But I think I should go to bed." 

"Of course Sean, but I think You better read aloud the list I'm showing you. It is a list of the definitions you learned today. Reading them before bed helps you recall them easier."

I grumbled: " Fine, show them to me in the bathroom mirror. I read them as I brush my teeth."

I jumped on the bed after that. 

"Good night Sarah. Please dim the lights in the next 5 minutes."

"Good night Sean. Have pleasant dreams."
